# Thankinator 2

An improved version of the [Thankinator](https://github.com/myers3jm/Thankinator)

This program is designed to run as a web application, and can be deployed to a Flask server using the included `build.sh`. Python 3.12 is required for this script to work, but later versions should work as well.

This program is incomplete. Large Language Models have replaced the core functionality of this service, and can do a better job of it. In the face of such competition, it did not make sense to continue developing this project.
